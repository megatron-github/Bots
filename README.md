# Bots
A program about pseudo-graphical objects

A bot is a creature that moves around a graphical window. All bots are drawn inside a square of a given width, with appropriate scaling. The program puts two of bots on the screen, with different sizes, and in different places, then it makes it so that when you click on a bot, it randomly moves or turns.
